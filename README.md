# 🛒 Customer Segmentation Analysis
**Python | License: MIT**

This project performs **customer segmentation** using demographic and transaction data from a wholesale company. By applying **unsupervised machine learning techniques**, customers are grouped into meaningful segments based on shared characteristics.

The insights gained help businesses **understand customer behavior**, **optimize marketing strategies**, and **increase customer lifetime value**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies by grouping customers based on similar behaviors and characteristics.

This project answers the key question:

> **“What are the distinct customer archetypes in our data?”**

Using clustering algorithms, we uncover patterns in customer personality and purchasing behavior to enable **targeted and data-driven decision-making**.

## 🎯 The Challenge
Understanding a diverse customer base is critical for business success.  
A **one-size-fits-all** approach often leads to:
- Ineffective marketing campaigns  
- Missed cross-selling opportunities  
- Lower customer satisfaction  

The challenge is to identify **distinct customer segments** and translate those insights into **actionable business strategies**.
